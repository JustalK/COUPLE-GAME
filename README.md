A project for presenting my professional work to the world in an app published on Google Store (in verification). As a fullstack developer, I have coded both side of the application. The app has been made with `React Native` and `Typescript` the backend is made with `Express` and `MongoDB`.

The entire project follow the official convention for JS. Also, the project is checked by `travis` and the test of `Jest` for checking the continuity. Finally, the robustness of the project is assured by `Coveralls` who checked the coverage of the test.

This project is linked to my other repository [PORTFOLIO](https://github.com/JustalK/PORTFOLIO). It's where I have designed the backend.

## Organization

The following describe how the project is structured. It's an easy way for discovering the project and the way I organize the code.
